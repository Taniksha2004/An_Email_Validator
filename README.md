# An_Email_Validator
I developed an email validation tool that provides real-time error checking and user feedback, ensuring a seamless experience. The tool's interface is designed to be both responsive and user-friendly, using HTML and CSS for a clean, intuitive layout that adapts well across different devices. I implemented client-side validation using JavaScript to check the email format, providing immediate feedback to users if their input is invalid. This real-time error handling helps prevent submission errors and enhances user experience.
